  {
    q: "What is Axiom?",
    a: "Axiom is a strategic thinking partner for founders and builders. It helps you track the commitments you make, notice when you're moving in a different direction, and maintain a permanent record of every choice that shapes your projects.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Decision Log?",
    a: "When you say something in chat that pulls against a committed decision, Atlas surfaces a log card. It shows you the tension quietly, lets you proceed with a reason noted, or adjust your direction. Every logged override lives in your Decision Ledger so you can trace your reasoning over time.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Decision Ledger?",
    a: "The Ledger is a live record of all committed decisions for a project. Entries are categorized as Committed (locked in), In Tension (flagged when direction shifts), or Overridden (consciously changed). You can view the full Ledger from the workspace right panel, or navigate to it directly from the side menu.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Parking Lot?",
    a: "The Parking Lot holds ideas and decisions that aren't ready to commit to yet. You can park something from a log card or manually from the Ledger. Parked items can be resumed (moved back to chat), committed directly, or deleted.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Home space?",
    a: "The Home space is your global strategic layer — where you think across all your projects at once without being locked into any single one. Atlas lives here and has visibility across your entire portfolio. It generates a briefing on load summarising where things stand, and maintains a persistent conversation thread across sessions. Access it from the bottom nav or the Atlas card in the side drawer.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does Atlas remember things between sessions?",
    a: "Atlas uses three memory layers: (1) Project Memory — a running log of facts Atlas learns about your project, stored in the database and injected into every chat. (2) Your User Profile — name, stack, and project notes stored in your browser's local storage. (3) AI Memory Protocol — during sessions, Atlas emits structured memory facts that are automatically saved and recalled next time.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Master Map?",
    a: "The Master Map (/map) is the satellite view of your entire Axiom ecosystem. The home space sits at the center as the anchor hub, and all your projects orbit around it as satellite nodes. Node glow intensity reflects recent activity — bright means actively worked on, dim means dormant. Tap any node to open its workspace or jump directly to its local System Map. Access it from the Projects drawer or the side menu.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the System Map?",
    a: "The System Map is the street view — a technical blueprint for a single project. It shows the architecture of your project (auth, database, API routes, state, UI, and business logic) as interconnected nodes. It lives inside each Atlas workspace under the Map tab. The Master Map is your satellite view of all projects; the System Map is your ground-level view of one.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I link a GitHub repository?",
    a: "In the workspace, open the Files tab and enter your GitHub personal access token. Once connected, you can browse your repos, open files into chat context, and link a specific repo to a project. Your token is stored locally in your browser and never sent to our servers beyond what's needed to call the GitHub API.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is Think Freely?",
    a: "Think Freely is a scratchpad mode — a space to write without Atlas in the loop. It's useful for brainstorming, drafting, or thinking out loud before you're ready to commit to anything.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the Guard Report?",
    a: "The Guard Report gives you a structural audit of your project's decision health — how many commits you've made, how many tensions have been flagged, and how your override rate looks over time. It's a diagnostic view, not a judgment.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I delete a project?",
    a: "Open the project workspace, then open the side menu (folder icon in the top-left). From there you can rename or delete the project. Deletion is permanent and removes all sessions, decisions, and chat history for that project.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my data private?",
    a: "Yes. Your projects, sessions, and decisions are private to your account. We do not sell your data or use it to train AI models. See our Privacy Policy for full details.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I contact support?",
    a: "Email us at support@intoinnovations.com. We typically respond within one business day.",
  },
