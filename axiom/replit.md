# Axiom-Atlas — Strategic Thinking Partner

## Product Identity

**Axiom** is the product. **Atlas** is the intelligence inside it. Nexus is retired as a user-facing name — internal file names (`nexus.ts`, `nexus.tsx`) stay as-is.

## Who This Is For

Jochanae — founder of Into Innovations. Builds production SaaS entirely from her phone using Cursor Agent on mobile. Four live products: CoinsBloom, Compani, PresentQ, IntoIQ. Axiom-Atlas is her fifth.

### How To Work With Her
- She builds from her phone. Always. Every prompt must assume mobile.
- She reviews screenshots before moving on.
- She builds by understanding, not just executing. Answer the "why."
- She has a strong visual eye. Trust her when something looks wrong.
- When things spiral, stop. Simplify or defer.
- "Let's move on" means done or deferred. Don't revisit unless she brings it back.

## Architecture

### Stack
- **Frontend:** React + Vite (`artifacts/atlas/`) — served at `/`
- **Backend:** Express 5 (`artifacts/api-server/`) — served at `/api`
- **Database:** Replit PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM (`lib/db/`)
- **AI:** Anthropic Claude `claude-sonnet-4-6` + Google Gemini `gemini-2.5-pro`
- **Monorepo:** pnpm workspaces

### Two Separate Chat Experiences

**1. Home Chat (Global / Atlas layer)**
- Lives permanently on the home page (`/home`) — does NOT navigate away
- Backend: `POST /api/nexus/chat`
- Focus chip: "All Projects" (default) or zoom into one project
- Mode chip: Strategic / Audit / Deep Dive
- Model picker: Claude (Nuance & Strategy) / Gemini (Long Context & Speed) — both fully wired
- Briefing: auto-generated portfolio intelligence on page load (`/api/nexus/briefing`)
- Briefing shortcut on "Where were we" card in below-fold section
- This is the wide-lens strategic layer — cross-portfolio visibility

**2. Workspace Chat (Project-specific / deep lens)**
- Lives at `/project/:id` — two-pane layout (chat left, Decision Ledger right)
- Backend: `POST /api/chat`
- Scope: one project, one linked GitHub repo
- Auto-indexes linked repo on workspace open (file tree + key files + analyze scan)
- Decision Catch Engine, FILE_EDIT protocol, GitHub write-back
- StackBlitz tab embeds the linked repo for live preview/edit

---

## Navigation Structure (Mobile)

Bottom nav: **HOME | PROJECTS | [A] | LEDGER | YOU**

Center A button → navigates to most recent project workspace

**Side drawer (folder icon):**
- ATLAS — Global View · All Projects (top card)
- PROJECTS section + project list
- NAVIGATE: Dashboard, Master Map, Parking Lot, Think Freely
- TOOLS: Workshop, Project Compass

## Session Memory System (Workspace)

Three-layer persistent memory:

1. **Project Memory (DB)** — `memory` column on projects table. AI writes facts using `PROJECT_MEMORY:` protocol. Injected into system prompt.
2. **User Profile (localStorage)** — name, stack, projects. Sent as `userProfile` with every chat request.
3. **Repo Scan (localStorage)** — `atlas-scan-{projectId}`. Auto-populated on workspace open. Sent as `projectMap` with every chat request.

---

## Auto-Indexing (Workspace)

When a workspace opens with a linked GitHub repo:
1. File tree + up to 5 key files are fetched and set as `fileContext` (immediate)
2. `/api/github/analyze` runs in background → caches structured map (routes, pages, components, tables, stack, summary) in `localStorage` as `atlas-scan-{id}` — skips if cache < 24h old
3. Server-side also auto-fetches file tree on every chat request
4. Server auto-selects and reads relevant files when build intent is detected

Result: Atlas knows the full codebase from message one — no FILES tab required.

---

## Decision Catch Engine

When user says something contradicting a committed decision, AI returns `DECISION_CATCH:{...}` JSON. Frontend renders a catch card:
1. Lead sentence explaining the tension
2. "Proceed anyway" → reason textarea
3. "Confirm" → logs deviation to ledger
4. "Adjust" (gold) → clears catch, refocuses input

---

## FILE_EDIT Protocol (GitHub Write-Back)

AI returns `FILE_EDIT_START / FILE_EDIT_CONTENT / FILE_EDIT_END` blocks. Frontend shows diff modal → user reviews → pushes to GitHub or creates PR. Multiple files per response supported.

---

## Design System

### Themes
- **Obsidian** (default/dark): Deep black-brown volcanic identity
- **Parchment** (light): Warm cream / cognac

### Identity Tokens
```css
--atlas-bg:          #0C0A09
--atlas-surface:     #1C1917
--atlas-fg:          #E7E5E4
--atlas-muted:       #78716C
--atlas-ember:       #92400E   /* Decision Catch, send button */
--atlas-gold:        #C9A24C   /* Accent — Ledger, labels, borders */
--atlas-border:      #252220
```

## What's Working (Verified in Code)

- Home chat with Claude and Gemini — both wired, model switching real
- Briefing — AI portfolio summary on load with cinematic reveal animation
- Focus chip (All Projects / specific project)
- Mode chip (Strategic / Audit / Deep Dive) — wired to system prompt
- Briefing shortcut on "Where were we" card — expands inline
- Password reset via Resend email
- In-app password change — wired in AccountHubPanel + backend
- Copy button on chat bubbles — home page
- Clear conversation — with confirmation step
- Session persistence — authenticated users skip landing
- Google OAuth — route registered and wired (needs live end-to-end test)
- Project archive/restore — active/archived sections in project list
- Workspace: Decision Ledger, catch engine, FILE_EDIT, GitHub read/write
- Auto-indexing on workspace open
- StackBlitz tab in workspace — embeds linked repo (public free; private needs StackBlitz login)
- Forge — strategic extraction engine with structured node output
- Stripe webhook auto-configures on server start; free plan capped at 1 project
- `/deep` research in workspace

---

## Requirements for Key Features

- **Google OAuth** — confirmed working in production
- **FILE_EDIT / GitHub write-back** — fully built. Requires: (1) a repo linked to the workspace, and (2) a personal GitHub token entered in the Files tab. Token is saved to the project in DB and sent as `x-github-token` on every write. Server's own `GITHUB_TOKEN` only covers reads — writes always use the user's token.

---

## Deferred — Do Not Lose

1. **Forge UI surfacing** — the backend is solid; the frontend needs better entry points and result integration into the workspace flow
2. **Secrets Vault** — per-project API key management (built, needs UX polish)
3. **Focus chip Atlas acknowledgment** — Atlas should open with the focused project named when a focus is active
4. **Lens per project** — changes Atlas response style per workspace
5. **Unified activity feed** — commits, decisions, sessions in one timeline

---

## Product Decisions — Locked

- Axiom = product. Atlas = intelligence inside it.
- Home page IS the global intelligence layer — lives there, never navigates away
- Two modes: wide lens (home, all projects), deep lens (workspace, one project)
- Think Freely, Master Map, AxiomFlow, Parking Lot all stay
- Model picker: Claude + Gemini only — GPT-4o, Perplexity, DeepSeek removed

---

## Cursor Prompt Pattern (Critical)

Every Cursor Agent prompt must follow this exact structure:
1. "Run `pnpm install` first if node_modules is missing."
2. Exact file path
3. Exact change — quote specific lines to find
4. "Do not change anything else"
5. "Run typecheck, push to main."

Installing packages: `pnpm add [pkg] --filter @workspace/api-server` or `--filter @workspace/atlas`. Never root-level.

After every push: Replit Git tab → Pull (manual pull required).
